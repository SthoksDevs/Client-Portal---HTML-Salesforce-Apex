# Client-Portal---HTML-Salesforce-Apex
The ClientProtal_Index_Controller class is designed for a Salesforce client portal to fetch and manage data related to projects and schedules associated with a specific account. It queries the Salesforce database to retrieve project and schedule information, categorizes them by status (Completed, In Progress, Awaiting Approval, etc.), and generates a set of JSON strings that represent calendar events. These events are stored in various lists and serialized into JSON format to be used in the front-end of the client portal.
